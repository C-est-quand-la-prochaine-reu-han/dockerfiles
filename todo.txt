URL rewrite on forwarded request to remove the trailing /prefix/ of the url

Use port specified in env instead of hard-coded 8080 in nginx reverse proxy configuration

Make the dockerfile composable => partly done

Create differents makefile rules to run : 
 - front-end developement on a dummy back-end => OK
 - api developement on a dummy database
 - game developement on a dummy database and a dummy api
